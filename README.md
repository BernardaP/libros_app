# Libros - Capstone Project


## Project Description 
Libros is a full-stack application that a book lover can use to catalogue their books by creating a virtual library. Libros allows the user to create a library/bookshelf by adding books using a search bar. 

The user search a book by title and chooses form the displayed list of results. The results are books displaying a title, author and image. Each result has a button that saves the book to the user’s library.

The library displays images of book covers and its titles, when the user clicks a book cover, a new page displays detailed information of the book. In this page the user can write comments about the book, rate the book, add a reading date and indicate if the book has been read completely. 

The user has the ability to delete a book from the library, organize the library alphabetically by genre/category, by title, or by author.
